    Example:
    --------
    Suppose `variables = [x, y]` and `degree = 2`. The function will return:
    
        [y^2, x*y, x^2]

def lie_derivative_mono(monomial, g, n = 0):
    '''
 This function computes the Lie derivative of a monomial with respect to a given matrix g of indeterminates, which represents an infinitesimal transformation. 
The derivative is computed by applying the transformation encoded in `g` to each variable in the monomial.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    monomial : Polynomial
        A monomial (single-term polynomial) whose Lie derivative is to be computed.
    g : Matrix
        The matrix representing the transformation with respect to which the Lie derivative is calculated.
    n : int, optional (default=0)
        The number of variables in the ambient polynomial ring. If not provided, it is inferred from the monomial’s parent ring.

    Returns:
    -------
    der : Polynomial
        The resulting polynomial after applying the Lie derivative.

    Notes:
    ------
    - The function constructs a dictionary that maps variables to their indices in `g`.
    - The derivative is computed by applying the transformation `g` to each variable in the monomial 
      and summing over the resulting transformed terms.

    Example:
    --------
    Suppose we have a monomial `m = x^2` and a transformation matrix `g`:

        g = Matrix([[0, -1], [1, 0]])  # A simple rotation matrix

    Calling `lie_derivative_mono(m, g, n=2)` would return the Lie derivative of `m` with respect to `g`.

def lie_derivative_poly(poly, g, n = 0):
    '''
    Computes the Lie derivative of a polynomial with respect to a given matrix.

    The function calculates the Lie derivative of a polynomial `poly` with respect to 
    a matrix `g`, which represents an infinitesimal transformation. The derivative is 
    computed by applying the Lie derivative operator to each monomial in the polynomial.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    poly : Polynomial
        The polynomial whose Lie derivative is to be computed.
    g : Matrix
        The matrix representing the transformation with respect to which the Lie derivative is calculated.
    n : int, optional (default=0)
        The number of variables in the ambient polynomial ring. If not provided (n=0), 
        it is inferred from the polynomial’s parent ring.

    Returns:
    -------
    der : Polynomial
        The resulting polynomial after applying the Lie derivative.

    Notes:
    ------
    - If `n` is not specified, it is inferred from the polynomial’s ring.
    - The function iterates through each monomial in `poly`, applying the Lie derivative.
    - The final derivative is obtained as a sum over all transformed monomials, weighted by their coefficients.

    Example:
    --------
    Given a polynomial `f = x^2 + xy` and a matrix `g` representing a linear transformation:
    
        g = Matrix([[0, -1], [1, 0]])   # A simple rotation matrix

def poly_to_vec(polynomial, n = 0, degree = 0):
    '''
    Converts a polynomial into its vector representation.

    This function takes a polynomial and returns its corresponding vector representation 
    by extracting the coefficients of all monomials up to a specified degree.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    polynomial : Polynomial
        The polynomial to be converted into vector form.
    n : int, optional (default=0)
        The number of variables in the ambient polynomial ring. If not provided (n=0), 
        it is inferred from the polynomial's parent ring.
    degree : int, optional (default=0)
        The degree of the polynomial. If not provided (degree=0), 
        it is inferred from the polynomial itself.

    Returns:
    -------
    vec : list
        A list representing the vectorized form of the polynomial, where each entry corresponds 
        to the coefficient of a monomial in the chosen basis.

    Notes:
    ------
    - If `n` is not specified, the function determines the number of variables from the polynomial's ring.
    - If `degree` is not specified, it is inferred from the polynomial.
    - The function constructs a monomial basis of the given degree and extracts coefficients accordingly.
    - The resulting vector has length equal to the number of monomials of degree `d` in `n` variables, 
      computed as `binomial(n + d - 1, d)`.

    Example:
    --------
    Given a polynomial in 3 variables:
    
        f = x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2 + xz
    
    Calling `poly_to_vec(f, n=3, degree=2)` would return a vector of coefficients 
    corresponding to the monomial ordering.
